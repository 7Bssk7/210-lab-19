An emotional rollercoaster and a perfect send-off.
Cap lifting Mjolnir was everything.
I cried when Tony snapped his fingers.

Rocket’s backstory broke me.
The soundtrack hit harder than ever.
A beautiful farewell to the team.

Seeing all three Spideys together was surreal.
Andrew Garfield stole the show.
The ending was unexpectedly mature.

A heartfelt tribute to Chadwick.
Shuri’s arc was powerful.
Namor was a compelling villain.
